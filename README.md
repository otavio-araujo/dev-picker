### Overview

This application offers support for real-time currency exchange rates. This feature is disabled by default. To enable it, you must first register for an API key at [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). The application uses this service due to its generous provision of up to 1,500 free API calls per month, which should be enough for development and testing purposes.

**Disclaimer**: There is no affiliation between this application and ExchangeRate-API.

Once you have your API key, you can enable the feature by setting the `CURRENCY_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file.

### Initial Setup

After setting your API key in the `.env` file, it is essential to set your `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` to ensure that the API accepts the correct comunication with the aplication.

So, open your `.env` file and create a new `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` key and paste your Token:

`GITHUB_API_TOKEN=github_pat_11AHIXSGY0PxxGnGX1c....`

This ensures the correct comunication whit Github Restfull API.

## Automatic Translation

The application now supports automatic translation, leveraging machine translation services provided by AWS, as facilitated by the [andrewdwallo/transmatic](https://github.com/andrewdwallo/transmatic) package. This integration significantly enhances the application's accessibility for a global audience. The application currently offers support for several languages, including English, Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Indonesian, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Turkish, and Chinese, with English as the default language.\*\*\*\*
